  3-part series on "society of the psyop" by Trevor Paglen::
  https://www.e-flux.com/journal/149/639555/society-of-the-psyop-part-3-cognition-and-chaos
  there will always exist a gap between "objective reality" and our phenomenological experience -- the qualia, shaped by memories, expectations, upbringing, culture, belief systems, etc. the article argues that this is an exploitable gap, a gap that "can be filled with all sorts of prompt injections and adversarial hallucinations". think propaganda, disinformation, conspiracy. think media manipulation, deepfakes, political polarisation from the crumbling of facts. "desire to believe eclipses the evidence at hand".
