  on x i float between the agi-bulls and agi-bears, and convos stretch from the most abstract and philosophical (e.g. what even is consciousness? what is human?) to technical (e.g. scaling laws, GPUs, computation). reading just a few hairs off of the wide scalp of the space. i struggle to put a framework together on how to even tackle this question: will we achieve AGI? 

  so how to begin thinking about this?
  <b>definition and scope of "general intelligence":</b> what is AGI? think this as the philosophical backbone -- defining human consciousness, intelligence, human distinctiveness. themes such as materialism, anthropomorphism, researching other forms of consciousness such as animal. what are the capabilities and behavious agi should have? as PMs like to say: what is the definition of done? 

  <b>building the "artificial":</b> what is the mode to attain this "a:? now convos around scaling laws, compute, computational representations of the mind. e.g. LLMs, agentic architectures, world models and embodied AI. memory systems, continual learning, self-reflection. exploring <i> how </i> agi can surface.
  
  <b>identifying constraints:</b> based on 1 and 2, what can we do now/soon? can GPUs/TPUs keep up? do we have enough data (e.g. real world robots), are our algos efficient enough? this gets more into the mathematical and technical.
