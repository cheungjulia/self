  content: `foundational models are slowing down, the ai product space is beginning to grow. there's a lot of noise, a lot of "chatgpt" wrappers, 20 YC companies doing a similar thing: medical advice ai, loveable for x, palantir for y, etc. yet not one has stood out yet. we're in a space of high-competition. i see so many twitter posts of new company launched announcements, but then never hear about them again. what will stick?
	- right now: they lack trust loops and they don't solve real pain points, sure there is a novelty but feels like people try them once then leave
	- ai as a feature, not a destination: companies that already embed customers into their workflows, e.g. notion, figma, salesforce, will win by absorbing ai into existing user behaviour rather than asking users to switch tools. if we built an ai product as standalone it either has to be 1) revolutionary for a current workflow; 2) currently unsolved / manual in a niche, narrow market
	- unique data as competitive advantage: e.g. an ai coach who knows your habits knows your preferences, progressions, and can tailor education to you; 
	- high-trust verticals: domains that like reliability, accuracy, emotional intelligence, the human touch, e.g. law and healthcare may adopt slower
	- how much do people actually use AI? am i just in a bubble??
